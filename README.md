# nightfever
Use the PIL/Pillow library in python to make background images.

The nightfever.py file is the main file. Currently, you'll need to edit it to choose
the image drawing algorithm. In order to affect the actual image, you'll need to 
edit the individual files containing the algorithms. 

Output images are stored in the output_images directory.
